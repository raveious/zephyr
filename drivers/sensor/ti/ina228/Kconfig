config INA228
	bool "INA228 current sensor"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_TI_INA228_ENABLED
	select I2C
	help
	  Enable driver for INA228 Bidirectional Current/Power Monitor.

config INA228_VSHUNT
	bool "INA228 shunt voltage measurement enable"
	depends on DT_HAS_TI_INA228_ENABLED
	help
	  Enable shunt voltage measurement for INA228.

	  This is the actual shunt voltage measured which is scaled within the
	  INA228 based upon the SHUNT_CAL register.

	  Note that enabling this option requires an extra I2C read when
	  SENSOR_CHAN_ALL is selected, so only enable if the shunt voltage
	  measurement is required.

config INA228_TEMPERATURE
	bool "INA228 temperature measurement enable"
	depends on DT_HAS_TI_INA228_ENABLED
	help
	  Enable temperature measurement for INA228.

	  Note that enabling this option requires an extra I2C read when
	  SENSOR_CHAN_ALL is selected, so only enable if the temperature
	  measurement is required.

config INA228_CUMULATIVE
	bool "INA228 cumulative charge and energy enable"
	depends on DT_HAS_TI_INA228_ENABLED
	help
	  Enable cumulative charge and energy measurement for INA228.

	  Upon overflow, the charge and energy values will roll over and start
	  from zero.

	  Note that enabling this option requires two extra I2C reads when
	  SENSOR_CHAN_ALL is selected, so only enable if the cumulative charge or
	  energy is required.
